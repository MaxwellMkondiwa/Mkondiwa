I am an adjunct research fellow at the Center for Agricultural Research and Development, Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources. 
I am also a research associate for the International Science and Technology Practice & Policy centre. 
My main areas of research interest are production and marketing economics. Beyond these
day job research areas, I have broad research interests including in what people call development 
economics, environmental economics, behavioural economics, GIS and spatial econometrics, Bayesian
econometrics, cultural economics, agronomy and philosophy. 

I obtained a PhD in Applied Economics at University of Minnesota in July 2019, MSc in Applied Economics at University of Minnesota in 2015, MSc in Research Methods at 
Jomokenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT), Kenya in 2012 and BSc in Agricultural Economics from Bunda College, Malawi in 2009.

I love playing soccer (alot!), watching soccer (alot as well) and reading philosophical novels 
(my favourite novelists are Tolstoy, George Eliot, Toni Morrison and Paulo Coelho).
