<p>I am a PhD candidate in Applied Economics at the University of Minnesota.
My main areas of research interest are production and marketing economics. Beyond these
day job research areas, I have broad research interests including in what people call development
economics, environmental economics, behavioural economics, GIS and spatial econometrics, Bayesian
econometrics, cultural economics, agronomy and philosophy.</p>
<p>I love playing soccer (alot!), watching soccer (alot as well) and reading philosophical novels
(my favourite novelists are Tolstoy, George Elliot, Toni Morrisoni and Paulo Coelho).</p>
