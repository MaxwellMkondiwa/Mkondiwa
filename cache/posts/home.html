<p>I am a PhD candidate in Applied Economics at the University of Minnesota.
My main areas of research interest are production and marketing economics.</p>
<p>My dissertation focuses on the economics of developing and deploying
agricultural research recommendations with measurable predicted rates of adoption
and economic welfare. The dissertation consists of three related papers. The first
paper resolves the crop response estimates puzzle of divergence between
experimental (i.e. agronomic experiments) and observational (e.g. farmer surveys)
crop responses to fertilizer application by proposing that a Bayesian combination of
these estimates leads to more profitable recommendations for farmers.
The second paper addresses the problem of identifying which traits/characteristics of
technologies will likely increase technology adoption given the interactions between
such characteristics and farmer characteristics.  The third and final paper addresses
the problem of analyzing economic impacts of agricultural policies while allowing for
spatial trade flows. In this paper, I develop a spatial sector programming model
for major food crops (maize, rice, cassava, potatoes, groundnuts and beans) in Malawi
that simulates food flows across districts given spatially specific agricultural policies,
transportation improvements and shocks (droughts or floods).</p>
