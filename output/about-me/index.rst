I am a PhD candidate in Applied Economics at the University of Minnesota. 
My main areas of research interest are production and marketing economics. 

I love playing soccer (alot!), watching soccer (alot as well) and reading philosophical novels 
(my favourite novelists are Tolstoy, George Elliot, Toni Morrisoni and Paulo Coelho).
