<p>This paper introduces two important extensions to the uncentered correlation metric,
the commonly used metric proposed by Jaffe [1986. “Technological Opportunity and
Spillovers of R &amp; D: Evidence From Firms’ Patents, Profits, and Market Value.”
The American Economic Review 76 (5): 984–1001] for analyzing research spillovers
across firms or countries. First, it is shown that the Jaffe metric can be displayed
graphically using the biplot, a graphical display of a two-dimensional approximation
to any multidimensional matrix. Second, it is illustrated that since the data used
to produce the Jaffe metric are constrained within the simplex (i.e. shares add up to one),
then a theoretically superior metric satisfying the basic axioms of technological proximity
measures in this sample space is the Aitchison distance measure, a metric based on
log-ratios of shares. The findings of the paper using agricultural research and
development spillover potential for Southern African countries show that the Jaffe metric
overestimates the technological proximity across countries as compared to the proposed
Aitchison measure.</p>

<p>This paper investigates the relationship between poverty and lack ofaccess to
adequate safe water in rural Malawi.Data used in the analysis was collected
from a survey covering 1,651 randomly selected households. We use Canonical
Correlation Analysis (CCA) as a distinct technique for understanding the
poverty–rural water access nexus. CCA results indicate that poverty in the
context oflow income and expenditure is positively correlated with lack of access
to safe and adequate water. Integrated Rural Water Resources Management (IRWM)
interventions are therefore needed to address both challenges ofpoverty and
poor access to adequate safe water in rural Malawi.</p>

<p>Considering that biofuels are considered as a catalyst for stimulating rural economic development,
a number of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have developed policies to guide the development
of the sector. This paper reviews the extent to which the existing biofuels policies and strategies
of SSA countries have embraced public-private partnerships (PPPs) and whether the policies enhance
or hinder such partnerships. In general, most SSA countries have no regulatory frameworks that have
led to some private firms taking advantage of this inactivity to acquire large amounts of land for
the growing of energy crops for biofuels at the expense of food crops, mostly involving smallholder
farmers. The paper proposes developing effective PPP arrangements in order to leverage the synergies
from the efficiencies of both public and private sectors. Such PPPs are crucial for mobilizing financial
resources to drive scientific research and innovations for developing advanced processing technologies for
second generation biofuels using lignocellulosic biomass as alternatives to traditional feedstock in order
to foster the commercialization of biofuels in SSA. In conclusion, as we now live in a global village,
countries must undertake detailed and systematic, country-specific assessments to ascertain the viability
and feasibility of biofuels, and define the “rules of the game” in order to protect rural dwellers from
loosing land to investors for growing energy crops and ensure equitable distribution of benefits of
biofuels investments without posing a threat to environment or intruding on the rights of citizens or
communities. Where biofuels are viable, PPPs should be part of the biofuels policy and investment
strategy in order to build trust, collective responsibility and joint risk management to achieve shared
outcomes for farmers, the investor and the environment.</p>

<li>Whither broad or spatially specific fertilizer recommendations? (with Terry Hurley). Revise and Resubmit.</li>
</ol>
<p>Are spatially specific agricultural input use recommendations more profitable to smallholder
farmers than broad recommendations?  Yes! This paper proposes a theoretical and empirical
modeling procedure for determining the economically optimal spatial scale at which agricultural
researchers can make soil fertility input use recommendations. Using geo-referenced on-farm fertilizer
verification trial data from Malawi, we find evidence that spatially specific soil fertility input use
recommendations for maize will always result in higher profits on average and even first order
stochastically dominate broad recommendations in some site-years. This result holds generally for
all stochastic profit functions that are non-decreasing and concave in both the optimal input use
levels and the stochastic crop response parameters.  We suggest several agricultural research policies
including, (i) input supplier (fertilizer and seeds) provision of recommendations, (ii) more research
directed towards heterogeneous environments and (iii) accounting of costs of agricultural research at
different scales when making input recommendations.</p>

<li>Closing the gap in experimental-observational crop responses: A Bayesian approach</li>
</ol>
<p>Crop response estimates to various farm inputs especially inorganic fertilizers are key ingredients
in policy and welfare analyses. The continuing divergence between experimental and observational crop
responses reported in the literature coupled with the recent debates on the costs and benefits of the
re-surging farm input subsidy programs in Africa have ignited the old problem of reconciling these estimates.
This paper argues that progress on closing the gaps has been minimal because the past literature has emphasized
the mean crop response differences, neglecting the distribution of these crop responses. I show in this paper
that a convenient way of dealing with different crop response function estimates is to use a Bayesian approach
to get combined estimates that are weighted by the uncertainty in each data source and can be adjusted for unobserved heterogeneity.
The plausible assumption that makes this approach optimal is that the experimental process overestimates the “true” crop response;
while observational methods overestimate failures. In general, the findings of this paper using nationally representative datasets
from Malawi show that ignoring the parameter uncertainty and heterogeneity in crop responses inevitably results in wrong policy prescriptions.</p>

<li>Estimating inter-district food flows in Malawi: Application of a Malawi Agricultural Sector Model</li>
</ol>
<p>This article develops a food sector spatially explicit mathematical programming model for Malawi
to estimate inter-district food flows and how transport cost variations affect these flows.
Inter-district trade data are not collected and thus not available in most sub-Saharan African
countries and many parts of world, yet such data would present opportunities for smarter and well
targeted development policies that allow for spillovers of impacts. We propose an interpretation
for the food sector model that allows a natural estimation of inter-district trade in data sparse
environments-where there are no district-district trade flows data and thus intra-national gravity
trade models are impossible to estimate. The interpretation is along the lines of a modified von Thünen “arrows”
theory in which transport costs determine the quantities and types of inputs or outputs that flow across the
different “separated” but not “isolated” districts. The calibration results for the baseline model show
that 16% of produced quantities of maize flow across districts as compared to more than 80% for rice, beans and groundnuts,
and 0% for cassava and potatoes. A simulation experiment of varying unit transport costs for both inputs and products
shows that reduction in per unit transport costs nonlinearly increases the share of production that is traded though
differentially across crops.</p>

Agricultural Economists (ICAE 2018) in Vancouver, Canada, 28th-31st July 2018.</p>
<p>Should a typical developing country invest more in agriculture or education? At what stage of development
is it optimal to invest more in each of these sectors? Every developing country government grapples
with these questions annually when designing a national budget. In this paper, I provide estimates of agricultural returns
to schooling in Malawi- evidence of such returns implies a more complex non-separable decision process to answer the first
question. While a large development economics literature has documented the effects of schooling on agricultural incomes,
such estimates are potentially biased because of unobserved heterogeneity and selection bias. In this paper, I use 2010-2013
two period nationally representative panel survey data in Malawi and rely on the exogenous education policy changes and
spatial variation in access to schooling to identify effects of schooling on agricultural incomes. In addition,
I use recent econometric methods to correct for selection into income activities within a panel data and instrumental variables estimation framework. I find annual agricultural returns to one additional year of schooling in Malawi that range from 3% to 7%.</p>
