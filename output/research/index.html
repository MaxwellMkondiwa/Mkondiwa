<p>Games are meant to be fun, yet economists have successfully developed games that are less
fun and less understood by participants especially in developing countries.
This paper surveys failures in risk attitudes elicitation in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and
questions the use of complex research tools such as multiple price list (MPL) approaches
and behavioral games that rural participants have never played before. The failures can be
avoided by using innovative research tools that ingest local activities like indigenous board
games that the rural people have played for generations because these games are entertaining
and closely related to the economic decisions they make. I provide a description of a variant
of the indigenous strategic games of Africa- Mancala- and suggest a research agenda that applies
the game in economics research—for risk attitudes elicitation, improving math skills of children
and behavioral game theory.</p>

Innovation and New Technology,2017, 17(6): 533-553.</p>
<p>This paper introduces two important extensions to the uncentered correlation metric,
the commonly used metric proposed by Jaffe [1986. “Technological Opportunity and
Spillovers of R &amp; D: Evidence From Firms’ Patents, Profits, and Market Value.”
The American Economic Review 76 (5): 984–1001] for analyzing research spillovers
across firms or countries. First, it is shown that the Jaffe metric can be displayed
graphically using the biplot, a graphical display of a two-dimensional approximation
to any multidimensional matrix. Second, it is illustrated that since the data used
to produce the Jaffe metric are constrained within the simplex (i.e. shares add up to one),
then a theoretically superior metric satisfying the basic axioms of technological proximity
measures in this sample space is the Aitchison distance measure, a metric based on
log-ratios of shares. The findings of the paper using agricultural research and
development spillover potential for Southern African countries show that the Jaffe metric
overestimates the technological proximity across countries as compared to the proposed
Aitchison measure.</p>

<p>This paper investigates the relationship between poverty and lack ofaccess to
adequate safe water in rural Malawi.Data used in the analysis was collected
from a survey covering 1,651 randomly selected households. We use Canonical
Correlation Analysis (CCA) as a distinct technique for understanding the
poverty–rural water access nexus. CCA results indicate that poverty in the
context oflow income and expenditure is positively correlated with lack of access
to safe and adequate water. Integrated Rural Water Resources Management (IRWM)
interventions are therefore needed to address both challenges ofpoverty and
poor access to adequate safe water in rural Malawi.</p>

<p>Considering that biofuels are considered as a catalyst for stimulating rural economic development,
a number of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have developed policies to guide the development
of the sector. This paper reviews the extent to which the existing biofuels policies and strategies
of SSA countries have embraced public-private partnerships (PPPs) and whether the policies enhance
or hinder such partnerships. In general, most SSA countries have no regulatory frameworks that have
led to some private firms taking advantage of this inactivity to acquire large amounts of land for
the growing of energy crops for biofuels at the expense of food crops, mostly involving smallholder
farmers. The paper proposes developing effective PPP arrangements in order to leverage the synergies
from the efficiencies of both public and private sectors. Such PPPs are crucial for mobilizing financial
resources to drive scientific research and innovations for developing advanced processing technologies for
second generation biofuels using lignocellulosic biomass as alternatives to traditional feedstock in order
to foster the commercialization of biofuels in SSA. In conclusion, as we now live in a global village,
countries must undertake detailed and systematic, country-specific assessments to ascertain the viability
and feasibility of biofuels, and define the “rules of the game” in order to protect rural dwellers from
loosing land to investors for growing energy crops and ensure equitable distribution of benefits of
biofuels investments without posing a threat to environment or intruding on the rights of citizens or
communities. Where biofuels are viable, PPPs should be part of the biofuels policy and investment
strategy in order to build trust, collective responsibility and joint risk management to achieve shared
outcomes for farmers, the investor and the environment.</p>

<li>Whither broad or spatially specific fertilizer recommendations? (with Terry Hurley). Revise and Resubmit.</li>
</ol>
<p>Are spatially specific agricultural input use recommendations more profitable to smallholder
farmers than broad recommendations?  Yes! This paper proposes a theoretical and empirical
modeling procedure for determining the economically optimal spatial scale at which agricultural
researchers can make soil fertility input use recommendations. Using geo-referenced on-farm fertilizer
verification trial data from Malawi, we find evidence that spatially specific soil fertility input use
recommendations for maize will always result in higher profits on average and even first order
stochastically dominate broad recommendations in some site-years. This result holds generally for
all stochastic profit functions that are non-decreasing and concave in both the optimal input use
levels and the stochastic crop response parameters.  We suggest several agricultural research policies
including, (i) input supplier (fertilizer and seeds) provision of recommendations, (ii) more research
directed towards heterogeneous environments and (iii) accounting of costs of agricultural research at
different scales when making input recommendations.</p>
<p>2. Closing the gaps in experimental-observational crop responses: A Bayesian approach.
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/MaxwellMkondiwa/Research/blob/master/MkondiwaPhDDissertation26thJune2019.pdf">Dissertation Chapter 2</a>.</p>
<p>A stylized fact of African agriculture is that crop responses to inorganic fertilizer application derived
from experimental studies are often substantially greater than those from observational studies (e.g., farm surveys and administrative data).
The divergence between experimental and observational crop responses reported in the literature, coupled with the
recent debates on the relative costs and benefits of the expensive farm input subsidy programs in Africa, have raised the
importance of reconciling these estimates. This essay argues that progress on closing the gaps has been impeded by focusing only on
mean crop response differences while ignoring the enormous uncertainty and heterogeneity arising from variations in soil types,
environmental conditions, and management practices. We show in this essay that a novel way of dealing with different crop response
function estimates is to use a Bayesian approach that combines information from both experimental and observational data to model
uncertainty and heterogeneity in crop yield responses. Our Bayesian approach has the advantage over conventional approaches to
assessing (spatially variable) yield responses in that it addresses the potential concern that the experimental process tends to
overstate observational crop response while observational methods tend to be muddled with behavioral (or crop management) factors.
Using nationally representative experimental, survey, and administrative datasets from Malawi, we find that: (1) crop responses to
inorganic fertilizer use are uniformly low in observational data, (2) there are large heterogeneities in yield responses across space,
and (3) ignoring parameter uncertainty and spatial heterogeneity in crop responses can lead to questionable policy prescriptions.</p>
<p>3. Characteristics space analysis of agricultural technology adoption
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/MaxwellMkondiwa/Research/blob/master/MkondiwaPhDDissertation26thJune2019.pdf">Dissertation Chapter 3</a>.</p>
<p>There are always at least two sides to every story and an economic story of the adoption of agricultural technologies
throughout sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is no exception. One familiar story highlights the “acceptance problem,” namely that
fundamental constraints in remoteness, weak markets, inappropriate policies, low education, cultural factors and many other
related constraints are key drivers to the low rates of technology adoption that prevail in many parts of SSA. The other story
focuses on the “availability problem,” which maintains that many newly available technologies fail to provide any relative
advantage in terms of their performance related attributes compared with the other (often status quo) alternatives.
This essay proposes a pure characteristics space analysis for both the acceptance and availability problems.
We illustrate this model using an application of the adoption of maize varieties in Malawi, a rapidly changing differentiated input market.
We find that farmers are willing to pay more for complex traits like drought tolerance and flint texture than yield differentials per se.
Our results (and the analytical approach we develop) have direct implications for maize breeding programs in Malawi.</p>
<p>4. Estimating inter-district food flows in Malawi: Application of a Malawi Agricultural Sector Model.
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/MaxwellMkondiwa/Research/blob/master/MkondiwaPhDDissertation26thJune2019.pdf">Dissertation Chapter 4</a>.</p>
<p>This essay develops a spatially-explicit, mathematical-programming model for the Malawian food sector to calibrate inter-district
food flows and to assess how transport cost variations affect these flows. Data on inter-district commodity trade flows
are typically not collected and are thus unavailable for most sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries and for many parts of world.
However, access to such data would present opportunities for smarter and better targeted development policies that allow for
the spatial spillover of interventions targeted to a specific locale. The food sector modeling approach we develop and implement
allows for a natural estimation of inter-district trade flows in data sparse environments where the lack of such data preclude
estimation of intra-national gravity trade models. Our modeling method is consistent with a modified von Thünen “arrows” approach
in which transport costs determine the quantities and types of inputs or outputs that flow across (spatially) “separated” but not “isolated” districts.
The calibration results for our baseline model indicate that about 7% of Malawian maize production flows among districts as
compared with more than 40% for rice, beans and groundnuts, and 0% for cassava and potatoes. A simulation experiment of varying unit
transport costs shows that reductions in per unit transport costs nonlinearly increase the share of production that is traded inter-regionally,
although the traded shares vary among the crops included in our model.</p>

Agricultural Economists (ICAE 2018) in Vancouver, Canada, 28th-31st July 2018.</p>
<p>Should a typical developing country invest more in agriculture or education? At what stage of development
is it optimal to invest more in each of these sectors? Every developing country government grapples
with these questions annually when designing a national budget. In this paper, I provide estimates of agricultural returns
to schooling in Malawi- evidence of such returns implies a more complex non-separable decision process to answer the first
question. While a large development economics literature has documented the effects of schooling on agricultural incomes,
such estimates are potentially biased because of unobserved heterogeneity and selection bias. In this paper, I use 2010-2013
two period nationally representative panel survey data in Malawi and rely on the exogenous education policy changes and
spatial variation in access to schooling to identify effects of schooling on agricultural incomes. In addition,
I use recent econometric methods to correct for selection into income activities within a panel data and instrumental variables estimation framework. I find annual agricultural returns to one additional year of schooling in Malawi that range from 3% to 7%.</p>
