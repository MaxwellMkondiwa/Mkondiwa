<p>
      A stylized fact of African agriculture is that crop responses to inorganic fertilizer application derived from experimental studies are often 
      substantially greater than those from observational studies (e.g., surveys and administrative data). Recent debates on relative costs 
      and benefits of expensive farm input subsidy programs in Africa, have raised the importance of reconciling these estimates. 
      Beyond mean response differences, this paper argues for including parameter uncertainty and heterogeneity arising from variations in soil types, 
      environmental conditions, and management practices. We use a Bayesian approach that combines information from experimental and observational data 
      to model uncertainty and heterogeneity in crop yield responses. Using nationally representative experimental, survey, and administrative datasets 
      from Malawi, we find that: (1) crop responses are low in observational data, (2) there are large spatial heterogeneities, and (3) based on 
      sensitivity analysis, ignoring parameter uncertainty and spatial heterogeneity in crop responses can lead to questionable policy prescriptions.

<p>
      Adjusting crop planting dates and variety durations is emerging as a crucial climate change adaptation strategy for many cereal systems. Such strategies include harmonizing crop planting with the onset of the rainy season or planting at specific recommended calendar dates. 
      Evaluations of these strategies mostly consider yield and yield variability, but focus less on financial risks associated with different planting strategies and importance of risk aversion behaviour of the farmers in their decision to adopt the strategies.
Here, we present a novel framework that uses a computational spatial ex-ante approach for risk-based evaluations of agronomic adaptation options. 
      This framework allows development agronomic adaptation recommendations that consider climate risks for risk-averse famrers.

<p>
      Malawi's export earnings are dominated by tobacco, accounting for over 60% of export earnings. The demand for an alternative export commodity, pigeon pea,
      has been rising over the past decade, especially from India. In addition to their export potential, pigeon pea is an effective cover crop to protect soil 
      heath and productivity in the dry season. They are mostly grown in southern region on very small farms, however, there are opportunities for expansion 
      into central region given the existence of larger farms and agroecological suitability for the crop. Currently, social norms in the central region constrain
      this expansion. Livestock, and goats in particular, are left to roam free in the dry season by over two-thirds of farmers, relative to only one-third in 
      the south. This leads to significant damage to pigeon pea crops and discourages farmers from growing them and taking advantage of the increased export 
      demand. Much land is left bare and the few farmers that do grow crops during the dry season are forced to put up fences. This study assesses ex-ante 
      implications, especially on agroecological transformation and economic growth, of shifting local governance arrangements among farmers around keeping 
      livestock towards controlled systems. These externalities have been understudied in the development programming, yet their impacts are substantial, 
      especially in lower-income countries. The policy solution under study is for the local government and non-state actors to support local governance 
      arrangements through indirect payments to agroecosystem services. These can include information campaigns on benefits of controlled livestock systems, 
      training and subsidizing modern goat house construction and feed preservation, and contract farming and product certification for adhering to acceptable
      community norms. Medium-term policy interventions include varietal development of adaptable short duration pigeon pea, initiating a review of the
      appropriate laws, and instituting more studies to understand these community norms.

<p>
      More than five billion metric tons of agricultural residues are produced annually worldwide. Despite having multiple uses and significant potential to augment crop and livestock production,
      a large share of crop residues is burned, especially in Asian countries. This unsustainable practice causes tremendous air pollution and health
      hazards while restricting soil nutrient recycling. In this review, we examine the economic rationale for unsustainable residue management. 
      The sustainability of residue utilization is determined by several economic factors, such as local demand for and quantity of residue production, 
      development and dissemination of technologies to absorb excess residue, and market and policy instruments to internalize the social costs of residue burning.
      The intervention strategy to ensure sustainable residue management depends on public awareness of the private and societal costs of open residue burning.

<p>
      Should a typical developing country invest more in agriculture or education? At what stage of development is it optimal to invest more in each of these sectors? 
      These are important questions that governments of developing countries grapple with when designing investment plans. In this paper, 
      I propose a soil–human capital conceptual framework of development and use it to explain estimates of agricultural returns to schooling in Malawi. 
      I use panel survey data for Malawi and rely on the exogenous education policy changes and spatial variation in access to schooling to identify effects 
      of schooling on agricultural incomes. In addition, I correct for selection into income activities within a panel data and instrumental variables estimation 
      framework. I find annual agricultural returns to schooling in Malawi of 3%–4% after correcting for selection and unobserved heterogeneity and 7% in the 
      uncorrected specifications. I also find consistently higher returns to schooling in the nonagricultural sector for those not living in the village of birth 
      and higher returns in the agricultural sector for those living in the village of birth. Given the size of the farm sector, wealth in Malawi is still in the soil, 
      but that future growth in wealth depends on human capital investments.

<a class="reference external" href="https://t.co/NAY8J8qWyn">Ungated version</a>.</p>
<p>
      Data on inter-district food flows are typically not collected and are thus unavailable for most sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries and 
      for many parts of world. Given the volatile and frequent regionally specific deficits in food production in Malawi, evidence on food flows under 
      different scenarios is needed for food policy decisions. This paper develops a spatially explicit mathematical programming model for the Malawian 
      food sector to calibrate inter-district food flows and to assess how transport cost variations affect these flows. The food sector modeling approach
      we develop and implement allows for a natural estimation of inter-district trade flows in data sparse environments. In addition, we restrict crop 
      mixes to those within the range of observed historical crop land use unlike modeling approaches that are prone to overspecialization. The calibration 
      results for our baseline model indicate that about 7% of Malawian maize production flows between districts as compared to 66% for rice, 74% for beans,
      and 46% for groundnuts. A simulation experiment of varying unit transport costs shows that reductions in per unit transport costs increase the share of 
      production that is traded inter-regionally, although the traded shares vary among the crops included in our model. The effectiveness of spatially targeted 
      food production and marketing policies in Malawi therefore depends on these baseline food flows and the associated inter-district trade costs. 
      Future research agenda on generating agricultural statistics in Malawi should focus on introducing intra-national commodity flow surveys.

<p>Games are meant to be fun, yet economists have successfully developed games that are less
fun and less understood by participants especially in developing countries.
This paper surveys failures in risk attitudes elicitation in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and
questions the use of complex research tools such as multiple price list (MPL) approaches
and behavioral games that rural participants have never played before. The failures can be
avoided by using innovative research tools that ingest local activities like indigenous board
games that the rural people have played for generations because these games are entertaining
and closely related to the economic decisions they make. I provide a description of a variant
of the indigenous strategic games of Africa- Mancala- and suggest a research agenda that applies
the game in economics research—for risk attitudes elicitation, improving math skills of children
and behavioral game theory.</p>

<p>This study examines the correlational relationship between the historical playing of indigenous strategic board games (also called mancala) and the socio-economic complexity of
African ethnic groups as well as the incidence of entrepreneurial pursuits. Anthropology literature suggests that these games may be associated with socio-economic complexity of the
ethnic groups—the so-called games in culture hypothesis. I revisit this hypothesis with better data and motivated by anecdotal evidence, introduce a contemporary hypothesis, origins
of entrepreneurship hypothesis—that descendants of societies that played complex mancala games are more likely to be engaged in non-farm self-employment today. I compile the
first comprehensive database of mancala games in Africa matched to ancestral characteristics data, and for 18 African countries, to the Afrobarometer survey data. Using historical
and contemporary data, I do not find evidence for either hypothesis. Despite the null results,
I explore how related hypotheses and studies can build on the comprehensive mancala
database.</p>

<p>This paper introduces two important extensions to the uncentered correlation metric,
the commonly used metric proposed by Jaffe [1986. “Technological Opportunity and
Spillovers of R &amp; D: Evidence From Firms’ Patents, Profits, and Market Value.”
The American Economic Review 76 (5): 984–1001] for analyzing research spillovers
across firms or countries. First, it is shown that the Jaffe metric can be displayed
graphically using the biplot, a graphical display of a two-dimensional approximation
to any multidimensional matrix. Second, it is illustrated that since the data used
to produce the Jaffe metric are constrained within the simplex (i.e. shares add up to one),
then a theoretically superior metric satisfying the basic axioms of technological proximity
measures in this sample space is the Aitchison distance measure, a metric based on
log-ratios of shares. The findings of the paper using agricultural research and
development spillover potential for Southern African countries show that the Jaffe metric
overestimates the technological proximity across countries as compared to the proposed
Aitchison measure.</p>

<p>This paper investigates the relationship between poverty and lack ofaccess to
adequate safe water in rural Malawi.Data used in the analysis was collected
from a survey covering 1,651 randomly selected households. We use Canonical
Correlation Analysis (CCA) as a distinct technique for understanding the
poverty–rural water access nexus. CCA results indicate that poverty in the
context oflow income and expenditure is positively correlated with lack of access
to safe and adequate water. Integrated Rural Water Resources Management (IRWM)
interventions are therefore needed to address both challenges ofpoverty and
poor access to adequate safe water in rural Malawi.</p>

<p>Considering that biofuels are considered as a catalyst for stimulating rural economic development,
a number of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have developed policies to guide the development
of the sector. This paper reviews the extent to which the existing biofuels policies and strategies
of SSA countries have embraced public-private partnerships (PPPs) and whether the policies enhance
or hinder such partnerships. In general, most SSA countries have no regulatory frameworks that have
led to some private firms taking advantage of this inactivity to acquire large amounts of land for
the growing of energy crops for biofuels at the expense of food crops, mostly involving smallholder
farmers. The paper proposes developing effective PPP arrangements in order to leverage the synergies
from the efficiencies of both public and private sectors. Such PPPs are crucial for mobilizing financial
resources to drive scientific research and innovations for developing advanced processing technologies for
second generation biofuels using lignocellulosic biomass as alternatives to traditional feedstock in order
to foster the commercialization of biofuels in SSA. In conclusion, as we now live in a global village,
countries must undertake detailed and systematic, country-specific assessments to ascertain the viability
and feasibility of biofuels, and define the “rules of the game” in order to protect rural dwellers from
loosing land to investors for growing energy crops and ensure equitable distribution of benefits of
biofuels investments without posing a threat to environment or intruding on the rights of citizens or
communities. Where biofuels are viable, PPPs should be part of the biofuels policy and investment
strategy in order to build trust, collective responsibility and joint risk management to achieve shared
outcomes for farmers, the investor and the environment.</p>

Causal Artificial Intelligence (Causal AI). NUTRI 2023 Conference at HAU </a>.</p>
</ol>
<p> Recent evidence suggests that there is a crop productivity growth slowdown in major crop production countries.
      Future changes in climate and land degradation further pose significant challenges for poor countries to increase crop 
      productivity needed to feed the growing population. Intensifying crop production through genetics, inorganic and organic inputs, 
      and irrigation therefore becomes a double-edged sword—needed, but potentially harmful to the environment. The increased availability of 
      big data and Causal Artificial Intelligence (causal AI) methods, however, provide a unique opportunity for real time science to drive 
      “smart” sustainable intensification through, for example, tailored agro-advisories that are differentiated by options and contexts, 
      that are profitable, climate risk proof, budget conscious, and inclusive. In this paper, we analyze the trends in the 
      spatial footprint of crop production practices across the globe to demonstrate the productivity slowdowns.
      We then propose an integrated framework for analyzing agricultural big data to allow for both increased productivity and
      sustainability. We conclude by proposing changes in the data ecosystem needed to drive the transitions including adaptive experiments 
      and surveys, coupling of machine learning, crop growth models, and bio-economic agricultural sector models within an umbrella of
      Knowledge Guided Machine Learning (KGML), capacity development in agricultural data sciences, and inducing institutional innovations
      for big data and Causal AI to flourish including open data and code sharing in a FAIR-ER (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable,

<li>Whither broad or spatially specific fertilizer recommendations? (with Terry Hurley). Revise and Resubmit.</li>
</ol>
<p>Are spatially specific agricultural input use recommendations more profitable to smallholder
farmers than broad recommendations?  Yes! This paper proposes a theoretical and empirical
modeling procedure for determining the economically optimal spatial scale at which agricultural
researchers can make soil fertility input use recommendations. Using geo-referenced on-farm fertilizer
verification trial data from Malawi, we find evidence that spatially specific soil fertility input use
recommendations for maize will always result in higher profits on average and even first order
stochastically dominate broad recommendations in some site-years. This result holds generally for
all stochastic profit functions that are non-decreasing and concave in both the optimal input use
levels and the stochastic crop response parameters.  We suggest several agricultural research policies
including, (i) input supplier (fertilizer and seeds) provision of recommendations, (ii) more research
directed towards heterogeneous environments and (iii) accounting of costs of agricultural research at
different scales when making input recommendations.</p>

<p>2. Characteristics space analysis of agricultural technology adoption
<a class="reference external" href="https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/206645">Dissertation Chapter 3</a>.</p>
<p>There are always at least two sides to every story and an economic story of the adoption of agricultural technologies
throughout sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is no exception. One familiar story highlights the “acceptance problem,” namely that
fundamental constraints in remoteness, weak markets, inappropriate policies, low education, cultural factors and many other
related constraints are key drivers to the low rates of technology adoption that prevail in many parts of SSA. The other story
focuses on the “availability problem,” which maintains that many newly available technologies fail to provide any relative
advantage in terms of their performance related attributes compared with the other (often status quo) alternatives.
This essay proposes a pure characteristics space analysis for both the acceptance and availability problems.
We illustrate this model using an application of the adoption of maize varieties in Malawi, a rapidly changing differentiated input market.
We find that farmers are willing to pay more for complex traits like drought tolerance and flint texture than yield differentials per se.
Our results (and the analytical approach we develop) have direct implications for maize breeding programs in Malawi.</p>

<p>Behavioral game theory has mostly relied on lab experiments using “simple games” developed by economists like beauty contest and centipede games.
This is problematic because such games are complex for participants due to unfamiliarity and unrelated to real-world decision making.
In this paper, I suggest a rethinking of the ideology and show that it is possible to use real-world games in behavioral game experiments.
Using mancala heuristics—sowing games commonly played in Africa, I show that standard behavioral game theory models (level k and cognitive hierarchy)
are inadequate to explain the more realistic multi-dimensional reasoning processes required in mancala.</p>
