1) `Graphical analysis of agricultural spillover potential
<https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/nsA7X2cgrAGtsX5dvzKu/full>`_. Economics of 
Innovation and New Technology,2017, 17(6): 533-553. 

This paper introduces two important extensions to the uncentered correlation metric, 
the commonly used metric proposed by Jaffe [1986. “Technological Opportunity and 
Spillovers of R & D: Evidence From Firms’ Patents, Profits, and Market Value.” 
The American Economic Review 76 (5): 984–1001] for analyzing research spillovers 
across firms or countries. First, it is shown that the Jaffe metric can be displayed 
graphically using the biplot, a graphical display of a two-dimensional approximation 
to any multidimensional matrix. Second, it is illustrated that since the data used 
to produce the Jaffe metric are constrained within the simplex (i.e. shares add up to one), 
then a theoretically superior metric satisfying the basic axioms of technological proximity 
measures in this sample space is the Aitchison distance measure, a metric based on 
log-ratios of shares. The findings of the paper using agricultural research and 
development spillover potential for Southern African countries show that the Jaffe metric 
overestimates the technological proximity across countries as compared to the proposed 
Aitchison measure.

2) `Poverty-Lack of Access to Adequate Safe Water Nexus: Evidence from Rural Malawi
<https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-8268.12048>`_. African Developmet Review ,2013, 25(4): 537-550.

This paper investigates the relationship between poverty and lack ofaccess to 
adequate safe water in rural Malawi.Data used in the analysis was collected 
from a survey covering 1,651 randomly selected households. We use Canonical 
Correlation Analysis (CCA) as a distinct technique for understanding the 
poverty–rural water access nexus. CCA results indicate that poverty in the 
context oflow income and expenditure is positively correlated with lack of access 
to safe and adequate water. Integrated Rural Water Resources Management (IRWM) 
interventions are therefore needed to address both challenges ofpoverty and 
poor access to adequate safe water in rural Malawi.

3) `Comparative analysis of biofuels policy development in Sub-Saharan Africa: The place of private and public sectors
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148112004491>`_. Renewable Energy ,2013, 50: 614-620.

Considering that biofuels are considered as a catalyst for stimulating rural economic development, 
a number of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have developed policies to guide the development 
of the sector. This paper reviews the extent to which the existing biofuels policies and strategies 
of SSA countries have embraced public-private partnerships (PPPs) and whether the policies enhance 
or hinder such partnerships. In general, most SSA countries have no regulatory frameworks that have 
led to some private firms taking advantage of this inactivity to acquire large amounts of land for 
the growing of energy crops for biofuels at the expense of food crops, mostly involving smallholder 
farmers. The paper proposes developing effective PPP arrangements in order to leverage the synergies 
from the efficiencies of both public and private sectors. Such PPPs are crucial for mobilizing financial 
resources to drive scientific research and innovations for developing advanced processing technologies for 
second generation biofuels using lignocellulosic biomass as alternatives to traditional feedstock in order 
to foster the commercialization of biofuels in SSA. In conclusion, as we now live in a global village, 
countries must undertake detailed and systematic, country-specific assessments to ascertain the viability 
and feasibility of biofuels, and define the “rules of the game” in order to protect rural dwellers from 
loosing land to investors for growing energy crops and ensure equitable distribution of benefits of 
biofuels investments without posing a threat to environment or intruding on the rights of citizens or 
communities. Where biofuels are viable, PPPs should be part of the biofuels policy and investment 
strategy in order to build trust, collective responsibility and joint risk management to achieve shared 
outcomes for farmers, the investor and the environment.

Working Papers
==============

1) Whither broad or spatially specific fertilizer recommendations? (with Terry Hurley). Revise and Resubmit.

Are spatially specific agricultural input use recommendations more profitable to smallholder 
farmers than broad recommendations?  Yes! This paper proposes a theoretical and empirical 
modeling procedure for determining the economically optimal spatial scale at which agricultural 
researchers can make soil fertility input use recommendations. Using geo-referenced on-farm fertilizer 
verification trial data from Malawi, we find evidence that spatially specific soil fertility input use 
recommendations for maize will always result in higher profits on average and even first order 
stochastically dominate broad recommendations in some site-years. This result holds generally for 
all stochastic profit functions that are non-decreasing and concave in both the optimal input use 
levels and the stochastic crop response parameters.  We suggest several agricultural research policies 
including, (i) input supplier (fertilizer and seeds) provision of recommendations, (ii) more research 
directed towards heterogeneous environments and (iii) accounting of costs of agricultural research at 
different scales when making input recommendations.

2) Closing the gap in experimental-observational crop responses: A Bayesian approach

Crop response estimates to various farm inputs especially inorganic fertilizers are key ingredients 
in policy and welfare analyses. The continuing divergence between experimental and observational crop 
responses reported in the literature coupled with the recent debates on the costs and benefits of the 
re-surging farm input subsidy programs in Africa have ignited the old problem of reconciling these estimates. 
This paper argues that progress on closing the gaps has been minimal because the past literature has emphasized 
the mean crop response differences, neglecting the distribution of these crop responses. I show in this paper 
that a convenient way of dealing with different crop response function estimates is to use a Bayesian approach 
to get combined estimates that are weighted by the uncertainty in each data source and can be adjusted for unobserved heterogeneity. 
The plausible assumption that makes this approach optimal is that the experimental process overestimates the “true” crop response; 
while observational methods overestimate failures. In general, the findings of this paper using nationally representative datasets 
from Malawi show that ignoring the parameter uncertainty and heterogeneity in crop responses inevitably results in wrong policy prescriptions.

3) Estimating inter-district food flows in Malawi: Application of a Malawi Agricultural Sector Model 

This article develops a food sector spatially explicit mathematical programming model for Malawi 
to estimate inter-district food flows and how transport cost variations affect these flows. 
Inter-district trade data are not collected and thus not available in most sub-Saharan African 
countries and many parts of world, yet such data would present opportunities for smarter and well 
targeted development policies that allow for spillovers of impacts. We propose an interpretation 
for the food sector model that allows a natural estimation of inter-district trade in data sparse 
environments-where there are no district-district trade flows data and thus intra-national gravity 
trade models are impossible to estimate. The interpretation is along the lines of a modified von Thünen “arrows” 
theory in which transport costs determine the quantities and types of inputs or outputs that flow across the 
different “separated” but not “isolated” districts. The calibration results for the baseline model show 
that 16% of produced quantities of maize flow across districts as compared to more than 80% for rice, beans and groundnuts, 
and 0% for cassava and potatoes. A simulation experiment of varying unit transport costs for both inputs and products 
shows that reduction in per unit transport costs nonlinearly increases the share of production that is traded though 
differentially across crops.

4) `Is wealth found in the soil or brain? Investing in farm people in Malawi
<https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/275914/files/2483.pdf>`_. Presented at the 30th Triannual International Conference for 
Agricultural Economists (ICAE 2018) in Vancouver, Canada, 28th-31st July 2018. 

Should a typical developing country invest more in agriculture or education? At what stage of development 
is it optimal to invest more in each of these sectors? Every developing country government grapples 
with these questions annually when designing a national budget. In this paper, I provide estimates of agricultural returns 
to schooling in Malawi- evidence of such returns implies a more complex non-separable decision process to answer the first 
question. While a large development economics literature has documented the effects of schooling on agricultural incomes, 
such estimates are potentially biased because of unobserved heterogeneity and selection bias. In this paper, I use 2010-2013 
two period nationally representative panel survey data in Malawi and rely on the exogenous education policy changes and 
spatial variation in access to schooling to identify effects of schooling on agricultural incomes. In addition, 
I use recent econometric methods to correct for selection into income activities within a panel data and instrumental variables estimation framework. I find annual agricultural returns to one additional year of schooling in Malawi that range from 3% to 7%.
